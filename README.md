# Pulmonar_Fibrosis_Progression

Fibrotic lung diseases are an open and difficult problem nowadays, due to its variety and severity. Current methos make fibrotic lung diseases difficult to treat, even with access to a chest CT scan. Fibrotic lungs affect patients capabilty to breath correctly and in several cases this decline is fast and agressive.

This project tries to predict the severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of patients lungs. Breathing capacity can be measured with a spirometer, which measures the volume of air inhaled and exhaled.

The challenge is to make predictions over the time with the CT_Scans images, metadata, and baseline FVC as input.
